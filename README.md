A simple chinese character note for primary school kids
------------------------

@2018/04/22

This is a two screen RNA aiming to provide extremely simple note-taking funcitonality for user. The original idea for this app was to create a tool for my son, to record the chinese HanZi(vacabulary) and to learn the Hanzi structure. So, each card has one big Hanzi or two to remember, coupling with the literal explanition as well as audio record(10 seconds long).


### To run this app:

```
$ npm install
$ react-native link
$ react-native run-ios
```
